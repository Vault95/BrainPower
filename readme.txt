If this is your first install OR you would like to re-install run Setup.bat file.

If you would like to update / check for updates to your current installation run the Update.bat file. This will match your install version to The Boys live server version

Note: This will NOT remove any additional mods you've added, however,  it may reconfigure some of the existing mods depending on updates.
